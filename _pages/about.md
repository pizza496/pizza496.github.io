Hello!

My name is Ben Spielman. I'm a former undergraduate and now graduate student at Santa Clara University pursuing my masters in mechanical engineering with a focus on design and manufacturing. Currently, I work at a firm specializing in the measurement of airborne particles. In my role I have: modeled and redesigned custom tooling to improve the assembly process, improved written documentation to reduce reliance on institutional knowledge, and more. This experience has sharpened my skills in communication and multitasking, and increased my understanding of how design choices impact manufacturing. 

I aspire to work in the scientific or medical device industry where I can create the most significant impact for the most people. In other words: my goal is to help create a better world by enhancing our collective scientific and medical technology.

Outside of school, I enjoy a wide variety activities like cooking, reading, martial arts, hiking, and photography.
