My goal with this speech is to give a basic overview on the components and process to make ice cream. I chose ice cream because the simplest recipes are really easy to follow and can create decent results. At the same time, making ice cream can be a really complex and involved. 

In short, ice cream has a very low threshold for entry, but is similarly able to challenge people from diverse levels of experience.

I'm not claiming to be an expert. I personally enjoy making ice cream as a fun desert, but I'm usually just following instructions with at most minor alterations to get the specific flavor I want.
