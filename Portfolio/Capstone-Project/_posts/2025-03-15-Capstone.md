My capstone project was the initial year in a multi year project with the goal of designing and building a high temperature furnace attachment for a tensile tester.

For this project I was one member of a team of 4. Due in part to budget constraints (new project & small team) we designed and built all the pieces for the furnace walls and designed mechanisms for the doors and to attach the furnace to the tensile tester. We did not have the manpower nor the experience in fields like electrical engineering to design the entire furnace, so we focused on making the most generally applicable chamber we could. This is by no means a perfect project. We had our challenges and setbacks, and with hindsight there are things I would change. If nothing else this was an incredible learning opportunity in how to handle complex challenges on a budget (both monetarily and chronologically).

For this project, my main focus was analyzing our design's cooling capabilities through finite element analysis done in Comsol. However, everyone helped with all aspects of the project.

A copy of the resulting thesis where we detailed our work, design choices, and challenges can be found [Here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/Capstone-Project/capstone.pdf).
