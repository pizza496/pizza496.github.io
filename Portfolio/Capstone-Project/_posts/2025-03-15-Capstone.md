My capstone project was the initial year in a multi year project with the goal of designing and building a high temperature furnace attachment for a tensile tester.

For this project I was one member of a team of 4. Due in part to budget constraints (new project & small team) we designed and built all the pieces for the furnace walls. This is by no means a perfect project. We had our challenges and setbacks, and with hindsight there are things I would change. If nothing else this was an incredible learning opportunity in how to handle complex challenges on a budget (both monetarily and chronologically).

A copy of the resulting thesis where we detailed our work, design choices, and challenges can be found [Here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/Capstone-Project/capstone.pdf).
